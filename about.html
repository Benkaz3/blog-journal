                <h1>Hi, I'm DÅ©ng</h1>
                <p>I am a web developer and I am currently learning React. This is my learning journal.</p>

            <h4 class="heading">How I stay committed to learning</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. 
                I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple 
                projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.<br><br>
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning 
                and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
            <h4 class="heading">How I got started</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. 
                I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, 
                I&#39d use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
                 summaries of what I learned using my own words.<br><br>
                 That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting 
                 my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
